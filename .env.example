# Optional: calendars per person or shared. Format: Names|ICS_URL (comma between entries).
# Names = one person (Alice) or several separated by ; for a shared calendar (Alice;Bob).
# Use name "Familjen" for a calendar where the whole family does something together; it is highlighted in the weekly summary.
# PERSON_CALENDARS=Alice|https://...,Familjen|webcal://...,Bob|https://...

# Optional (fallback): global ICS URLs when PERSON_CALENDARS is not set. Comma-separated. webcal:// OK.

# Optional: timezone for calendar week and event times (e.g. Europe/Stockholm). Default: Europe/Stockholm.
